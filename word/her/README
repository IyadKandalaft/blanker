If you're not familiar with the style of joke format it goes something
like this. The setup is usually Alice and Bob are dating and Bob's
friend Chis comes to hang out with them and meet Alice for the first

Chris says 'What should we do?'  
Bob, a gambler, replies 'Poker.'  
Chris jokes 'Poke her? I barely know her!'

The code in her.py allows you to create the master list of these by
running her.py on the command line. The program takes 2 arguments, a
word and how many of the end phonemes you want to match. So for her
the command would be:

python her.py her 1

For funny ones of him, them or it you need to match 2 phonemes. You
can also pass it an optional 3rd argument which will be a file to
write results to
